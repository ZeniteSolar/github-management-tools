# About

## This Project

This repository concerns a project that is part of a larger project: an opensource powered solar boat, that is being developed since 2013.

## The Zênite Solar Boat Team

The Zênite Solar Boat Team is a multi-disciplinary team composed of students from the [Federal Institute of Santa Catarina](https://www.ifsc.edu.br/about-ifsc), that every year improve the boat by redesigning almost all its parts.

As the team strives to build all the boat parts every competition, the boat is in constant innovation, being recognized as the most innovative solar boat team from Brazil. 

All the developed electronic systems are open source (hardware and software) and are publicly available on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/ZeniteSolar).

## The Brazil Solar Challange

The Brazil Solar Challenge (portuguese: Desafio Solar Brasil) is a competition of boats that can only use solar energy to power all its systems, including the propulsion. To do that, the boats use photovoltaic solar panels and stores this energy in a limited batterie bank.
